# Image_To_ASCII_Image_Converter
This Python project converts images into ASCII art displayed in the terminal while playing background music. Using Pillow for image processing and Pygame for audio, it enhances brightness and contrast for clear output. With multithreading, both visuals and music run smoothly for a creative, artistic experience.
