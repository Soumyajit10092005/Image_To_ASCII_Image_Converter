# 🖼️ Image to ASCII Art with Background Music 🎵

This Python project transforms any image into a stunning ASCII art animation displayed directly in your terminal, accompanied by background music.  
It combines **Pillow** for image enhancement, **Pygame** for audio playback, and **multithreading** for smooth performance.  
The project is designed for creative programmers who love combining technology and art.

---

## 🌟 Overview

The script reads an image, converts it into grayscale, enhances brightness and contrast, and then maps each pixel’s brightness value to an ASCII character.  
It creates an animated text version of your image that appears line by line in the terminal.  
At the same time, background music plays using **Pygame**, creating a unique, synchronized audio-visual experience.
